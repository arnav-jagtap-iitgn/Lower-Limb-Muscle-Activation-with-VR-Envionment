# Lower-Limb-Muscle-Activation-with-VR-Envionment
**Professor:** Prof. Uttama Lahiri  
**Institution:** IIT Gandhinagar  


- Developed an immersive Virtual Reality environment using Vizard and Python, integrated with the Wii Balance
Board, BNO055 IMU, and sEMG acquisition system to support interactive balance training.
- Processed surface EMG (sEMG) signals in MATLAB using advanced filtering and signal processing techniques to
assess lower limb muscle synergy during physical activity.
- Calibrated BNO055 sensor with a servo motor to enable accurate angle tracking for movement analysis in real time.
- Interfaced an FSR sensor with Arduino, establishing a wireless connection via HC-05 Bluetooth to detect leg uplift;
this real-time data was fed into the VR system to enhance biofeedback and interactivity.
